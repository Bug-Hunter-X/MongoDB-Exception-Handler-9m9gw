# Unhandled Exceptions in MongoDB Interaction

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB interactions: failing to handle potential exceptions during database connection or query execution. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that incorporates robust error handling.

The original code attempts to connect to a MongoDB database, perform a query, and then close the connection.  However, it lacks proper error handling.  If any step fails, the application might crash unexpectedly.

The improved solution demonstrates how to use `try...catch` blocks to catch and handle potential exceptions, providing more informative error messages and preventing application crashes.
